ðŸ“š Hey there! I'm Amitai Debiche, currently an undergraduate at UW-Madison, majoring in **Computer Science** with Honors!

ðŸŒ± I've recently embarked on the exciting journey of managing my own server, nestled snugly with a MikroTik router at a colocation datacenter. Navigating through the intricacies of server management and cybersecurity has been an exhilarating challengeâ€”I may not have all the answers yet, but I'm constantly learning and improving. And oh, did I mention I'm also venturing into the realm of Go programming and trying to improve my frontend skills? Of course, I am also sharpening my problem-solving abilities with Advent of Code and (I need to do more) LeetCode challenges. The learning never stops! ðŸ’»

(Also, a slight shill for a product I've found-ðŸŒŸTailscaleðŸŒŸ. I have an additional "home server," which is just an old PC in my room. Tailscale is awesome; It lets me still be able to access it behind CGNAT, and has other cool features. Awesome product. If one of their recruiters or engineers sees this, y'all are awesome (and by chance do you need an intern/co-op? ðŸ‘€).)

ðŸ’¬ Outside of tech stuff, I am passionate about (aka obsessed with) snowboarding, and have newly gotten into splitboarding! Additionally, I enjoy the now-stereotypical tech guy sport of rock climbing, and the somewhat less stereotypical soccer and swimming.
