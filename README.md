ðŸ“š Hey there! I'm Amitai Debiche, currently an undergraduate at UW-Madison, majoring in **Computer Science** with Honors just trying to learn to make cool things!

ðŸŒ± I've recently embarked on the exciting journey of managing my own server, nestled snugly with a MikroTik router at a colocation datacenter. Navigating through the intricacies of server management and cybersecurity has been an exhilarating challengeâ€”I may not have all the answers yet, but I'm constantly learning and improving. Additionally, I'm  venturing into the realm of Go programming while also trying to improve my frontend development skills!
